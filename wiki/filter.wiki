=What is a filter?=
In Cherry On Ext filters have only only 2 components:
 # conditions that are made of a field, an operator and a value. For example: `name = John`. This are known as elementary filters. In the example, name is the field, = is the operator and John is the value
 # conditions that are the composition of 2 filters (left and right), connected with a logical operator. For example `name = John and age > 12`. In the example and is the logical operator, `name = John` is the left side and `age > 12` is the right side

Filter defintion using BNF:

{{{
<filter> ::= <listof elementary_filter>
<listof elementary_filter> ::= <elementary_filter> [<op> <listof elementary_filter>]
<op> ::= AND | OR
<elementary_filter> ::= <field> <operator> <value>
<operator> ::= <num_op> | <string_op> | <date_op>
<string_op> ::= “=” | “!=” | “begins with” | “ends with” | “contains” | “not contains ”
<num_op> ::= “=” | “!=” | “>” | “<” | “>=” | “<=” | "number between"
<date_op> ::= “=” | “>” | “<” | “>=” | “<=” | <date between> | <date period>
<field> ::= whatever identifier valid in the underlying domain
<value> ::= any value(s) permitted for the associated field

}}}

The value format depends on the operator. 
For example if the operator is "date between" the value has the format: "from <date> to <date>", where the date format is mm/dd/yyyy hh:mi.
If the operator is "date period" the value is one of: “last year”,“last month”,“last week”,“last day”,“last hour”,“last quarter”.
