=What is a filter?=
In Cherry On Ext filters have only only 2 components:
 # conditions that are made of a field, an operator and a value. For example: `name = John`. This are known as elementary filters. In the example, name is the field, = is the operator and John is the value
 # conditions that are the composition of 2 filters (left and right), connected with a logical operator. For example `name = John and age > 12`. In the example and is the logical operator, `name = John` is the left side and `age > 12` is the right side
=Filter Model=
This is the UML class diagram of the filter explained in the above paragraph

=Managing Filters=
Cherry mantaines the filter internally as explained above. To interact with cherry you can use the classes, or in a easier way you can use some javascript object that reflects the internal cherry model.

Example:
{{{
{left:
  {fieldId:"field2",
    operatorId:"STRING_LIST",
    values:[{value:"valoreRemoto3",label:"labelRemota3"},{value:"valoreRemoto1",label:"labelRemota1"}]
   },
  logicalOperator:"AND",
  right:{
    fieldId:"field4",
    operatorId:"DATE_EQUAL",
    values:[{"value":"2008-02-25 00:30:00","label":"25/02/2008 00:30"}]
  }
}
}}}
