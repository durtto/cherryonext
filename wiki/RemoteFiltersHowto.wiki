#summary How to implement remote filters using Cherry on Ext with a PHP example


In the demos, since we don't have access to a DB in a public web space, we use LocalStoreFilterResolver to filter a local store. Here I will explain how to filter remote data, and I will give an example php code to translate a filter expression to a SQL where clause (Oracle 9i or better)


= Client =
To filter a grid you have to filter the data in the grid's store. If the store obtains the data from a remote URL, the standard Ext JS way to load the data is the following:
{{{
store.load({params: {start:0, limit: 20}});
}}}

If you want to send filter information a way is the following:
{{{
  store.load({params: {start:0, limit: 20,filter: Ext.util.JSON.encode(filterModel.getFilterObj())}});
}}}
where filterModel is the Ext.ux.netbox.core.FilterModel used to filter on the grid. In this way your url will have a filter parameter containing the filter object encoded using JSON.
Now, if you try to sort your grid clicking on the header of the cell, you will see that the filter is lost. To have the filter as a persistent options of the store you shoild use the baseParams attribute of the store:
{{{
  store.baseParams=Ext.apply(store.baseParams,{filter: Ext.util.JSON.encode(filterModel.getFilterObj())});
  store.load({params: {start:0, limit: 20}});
}}}

On the server you have to decode the object from JSON (there are implementation on most of the languages, just google for JSON <language name>). Then you probably want to transform this object in a SQL where condition.
